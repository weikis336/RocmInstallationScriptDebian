# ROCM on Debian 12 script
This its a litle bash script to quick setup Rocm on AMD in Debian 12 bookworm 
Install Rocm on debian its a bit treaky beacause there is no package related on the debian repos. 

Because of that blender HIP or other apps are a bit hard to set up

Special thanks to https://gitlab.com/gee-one/debian-12-rocm


### The main script its the RocMinstall.sh
